	<h2>Computer Science</h2>
	<p>																								<!-- Paragraph 1 / 3 -->
		I'm currently studying Computer Science at Utah State University and I love it. I've been
		doing technical work either in school or in the workplace for close to five years now, and
		nothing quite compares to solving challenging problems in code and developing elegant
		algorithms.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm still working on my undergraduate work in college, but I'm currently planning on
		pursuing a Computer Science PhD with an emphasis on artificial intelligence. I'm considering
		doing my dissertation on a topic in natural language processing, but I haven't committed to
		that quite yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		As far as a career is concerned, I'm thinking of spending some time either writing technical
		software for a company in a STEM field, working with medical suppliers to develop new
		solutions for use in healthcare, or doing research and teaching at a university. To learn
		more about my career plans and how I plan to use technology to accomplish my goals, visit my
		second page.

	<h2>Baking and Culinary Arts</h2>
	<p>																								<!-- Paragraph 2 / 3 -->
		One of my major hobbies outside of school and work is baking. I've been interested in it
		ever since I read a story about my great-grandfather. His first career was as a baker in
		Varde, the city in Denmark where he grew up. Sometimes I think about him while I'm baking,
		wondering what it must have been like to make breads and cakes a hundred years ago.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I told my dad I wanted to learn to bake like my great-grandfather, he took me out to
		buy my first cookbook, which I still use to this day. It's a Better Homes and Gardens book
		filled with all sorts of baking goodies, from cookies and brownies to wedding cakes and
		traditional swedish confections.
	</p>
	<p>
		My favorite thing to bake is also the first thing I tried. Banana bread. It's always been a
		family favorite with my dad's family, and my Better Homes and Gardens cookbook has a
		delicious recipe, which I've included to the side if you want to try it yourself.

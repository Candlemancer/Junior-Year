		I'm currently studying Computer Science at
		<a href="http://www.usu.edu/" target = "_blank">Utah State University</a>					<!-- Link 2 / 5 -->
		and I love it. I've been doing technical work either in school or in the workplace for close
		to five years now, and nothing quite compares to solving challenging problems in code and
		developing elegant algorithms.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm still working on my undergraduate work in college, but I'm currently planning on
		pursuing a Computer Science PhD with an emphasis on artificial intelligence. I'm considering
		doing my dissertation on a topic in natural language processing, but I haven't committed to
		that quite yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		As far as a career is concerned, I'm thinking of spending some time either writing technical
		software for a company in a STEM field, working with medical suppliers to develop new
		solutions for use in healthcare, or doing research and teaching at a university. To learn
		more about my career plans and how I plan to use technology to accomplish my goals, visit my
		second page.

		One of my major hobbies outside of school and work is baking. I've been interested in it
		ever since I read a story about my great-grandfather. His first career was as a baker in
		<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nf45O" target = "_blank" >Varde</a>, the city in Denmark where <!-- Link 3 / 5 -->
		he grew up. Sometimes I think about him while I'm baking, wondering what it must have been
		like to make breads and cakes a hundred years ago.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I told my dad I wanted to learn to bake like my great-grandfather, he took me out to
		buy my first cookbook, which I still use to this day. It's a Better Homes and Gardens book
		filled with all sorts of baking goodies, from cookies and brownies to wedding cakes and
		traditional swedish confections.
	</p>
	<p>
		My favorite thing to bake is also the first thing I tried: banana bread. It's always been a
		family favorite with my dad's family, and my Better Homes and Gardens cookbook has a
		delicious recipe. You can find the book on amazon
		<a href="http://goo.gl/YX0h2B" target = "_blank">here</a>.									<!-- Link 4 / 5 -->

		Some of my other hobbies include reading novels, writing poetry, and solving puzzles and
		problems. My father is a mathemetician, and my mother a poet, so I grew up with in a very
		academic setting. As a result, I've always done very well academically, as long as I can
		find motivation to put in a little effort.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of the reading I do nowadays is either textbooks or fiction novels. My favorite author
		is Brandon Sanderson, who is known for his epic fantasy books. If you're interested, check
		out his <a href="http://brandonsanderson.com/" target = "_blank">website</a>. I also enjoy	<!-- Link 5 / 5 -->
		reading a good mystery novel.

		Academically, I'm currently attending Utah State University. I'm in my Junior year of the
		computer science program, and I've completed four semesters of classes here. The following
		is a table of my classes to date.

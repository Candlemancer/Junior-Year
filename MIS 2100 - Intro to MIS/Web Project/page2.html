<p>
	The area of business I'm most interested in pursuing a career in is information technology.
	Computer software is almost ubiquitously used across all parts of business, but the two
	career paths that I'm particularly interested in are those of Systems Administrators and
	Software Engineers.
</p>
<p>
	Systems Administrators generally manage and maintain the IT infrastructure of a business,
	insuring that computer systems and other technology are operating at maximum efficiency for
	the benefit of the company. They often handle many types of tasks, including maintenance and
	repair work of existing systems, deployment of new technology to help the business expand,
	and development of new tools for specialized business needs.
</p>
<p>
	Software Engineers, on the other hand, are almost entirely focused on building new tools or
	products for the use of the business. They generally solve the most challenging and complex
	problems that arise from the development of these tools, and in many businesses the software
	they create is the primary product of the business. As a result, software engineers are one
	of a business's most valuable resources, and a high-quality software engineer is a
	tremendous boon to a company's productivity.
</p>

<p>
	Some of the IT skills needed for these postions are:

	<ul>
		<li>Critial Thinking Skills : These positions require employees to be able to dissect
		a problem into its component parts, and objectively measure metrics such as
		maintainability, scalability, and effectiveness.</li>
		<li>Interpersonal and Technical skills : More than most employees, these people must be
		able to interact well with both other employees and the machines and tools they use.
		Often times these employees function as a bridge between technology and humanity in a
		business, and must feel comfortable working with both sides of that relationship.</li>
		<li>Logical Skills : Both of these positions require a lot of logical thought, and one
		who can fully comprehend and understand complex systems and processes can often figure
		out ways that those systems or processes can be improved. Being able to accurately find
		places where the business is doing things redundantly or improve things the business
		does frequently are large parts of what makes these employees truly shine.</li>
	</ul>
